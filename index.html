            <p>A steak is a meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, potentially including a bone. It is often
                grilled in an attempt to replicate the flavor of steak cooked over the glowing coals of an open fire.
                Steak can also be cooked in sauce, such as in steak and kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties.
